Distributed Async Await is a programming model based on async await that offers a simple, delightful developer experience for building modern, concurrent and distributed applications.

Distributed Async Await is a procedure-based programming model on top of an event-driven execution model.

```typescript
// A concurrent, distributed, long-running workflow that reads like a simple loop
function countdown(context : Context, phone : string, count : number) {

  for(let index = count; index > 0; index--) {

    // Call local or remote functions with the same syntax and semantics
    await (async notify(phone, index));

    // Sleep for hours, days, weeks, months, or years
    await sleep("1 day";)

  }

}
```

### Grammer

# Distributed Async Await 

## Version 1.0 (Unreleased)

### *Summary*

The purpose of this document is to formalize Distributed Async Await－an open, vendor-neutral specification of a programming model based on async await and an underlying scalable and reliable distributed execution model.

### Context

Today, the question is no longer whether an application is concurrent and distributed, but only to what extent an application is concurrent and distributed. Today, concurrency and distribution are fundamental aspects of software engineering.

Multiple popular concurrent programming models have emerged, that is, programming models tht elevate concurrency to a first class citizen, aiming to improve building non-distributed, concurrent applications. However, no popular concurrent and distributed programming models have emerged yet.

:::info[Concurrency and Distribution]

Concurrency and distribution are fundamental aspects of software engineering. In the context of this specification, concurrency and distribution are charaterized as: 

#### Concurrency

The defining charateristic of concurrency is non-determinisitic execution order. In a concurrent system, we do not know what happens next.

#### Distribution

The defining charateristic of distribution is non-determinisitic partial failure. In a distributed system, we do not know what fails next.

Therefore, by definition, a concurrent and distributed programming model supports *coordination* to tame non-determinisitic execution order and *recovery* to tame non-determinisitic partial failure.

### Purpose of the specification

The purpose of this document is to formalize Distributed Async Await－an open, vendor-neutral specification of a programming model based on async await and an underlying scalable and reliable distributed execution model.

Distributed Async Await is a programming model that offers a delightful developer experience for building scalable and reliable distributed systems by making concurrency and distribution first class citizens of the programming model.

:::info[Developer Experience and Simplicity]

Developer experience is often described through two lenses: the subjective lens of developer satisfaction and the objective lens of developer productivity. While challenging to define, developer experience remains a critical aspect of software development.

This specification ties developer experience to simplicity. We posit that a delightful developer experience emerges from systems that are:

- Simple to understand
- Simple to develop
- Simple to operate

**complex problems, simple code, peace of mind**

### Structure of the specification

This specification consits of three prescriptive parts:

1. Specification of the programming model
2. Specification of the execution model
2. Specification of the system model

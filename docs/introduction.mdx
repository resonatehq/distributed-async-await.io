# Distributed Async Await
## Suspend Anytime, Resume Anywhere
#### 


_This is an open, vendor-neutral specification of Distributed Async Await, a durable execution framework based on async await._

- _Based on Functions and Promises_
- _Simple to understand_
- _Simple to develop_
- _Simple to operate_

**Developed by [Resonate HQ](https://resonatehq.io)**

## Context

The purpose of this document is to formalize Distributed Async Await, an open, vendor-neutral specification of a durable execution framework with a delightful developer experience.

Do's

- Standard programming model based on functions and promises
- Simple protocols
- Open ecosystem

Don'ts

- No proprietary programming models such as workflows and activities
- No complex technology stacks
- No vendor lock-in

:::info Developer Experience and Simplicity

Developer experience is often described through two lenses: the subjective lens of developer satisfaction and the objective lens of developer productivity. This specification ties developer experience to simplicity. We posit that a delightful developer experience emerges from systems that are:

- Simple to understand
- Simple to develop
- Simple to operate

:::

## Structure of the specification

This specification consits of three prescriptive parts:

1. Specification of the [programming model](/specification/programming-model)
2. Specification of the [execution model](/specification/execution-model)
3. Specification of the [system model](/specification/system-model)

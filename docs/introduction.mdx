**Welcome to the Distributed Async Await specification.**

Today, every application is **a concurrent and distributed application**.
The question is no longer _if_ an application is concurrent and distributed, _but to what extent_.
Concurrency and distribution are now fundamental to software engineering.

Yet, they (concurrency and distribution) are still largely handled at the application level.
Modern attempts to move them into the platform layer often introduce even more complexity.
This complexity degrades a developer's experience, which is tied to the quality of their output.

This specification formalizes **Distributed Async Await** — an open, vendor-neutral programming model designed to extend mainstream languages with native support for concurrency and distribution, without adding complexity or obscuring control.
The model builds on generic _async/await_ semantics and an underlying **asynchronous remote procedure call** mechanism.

Beyond just mechanics, this specification introduces a **way of thinking** about distributed systems — that is, this specification introduces a specific system model that sets the foundation on which the specification is built.

Distributed Async Await is not bound to any specific language or runtime.
It is intended to be **implemented broadly**, across ecosystems, to support a unified approach to building resilient, transparent distributed systems.

:::tip Fundamental unit of locality

Processes are the fundamental unit of locality in a system.

:::

On a process level, a system is a collection of processes, each process has a unique identity.
A process has a well-defined lifecycle, represented by the lifecycle events _init_ and _term_, that governs its participation in the system:

**_init_** marks the initialization of the process and represents its entry into the system.

**_term_** marks the termination of the process and represents its exit from the system.

A process cannot emit events outside its (_init_, _term_) interval.
As a consequence, a process cannot announce its termination after its termination.
Instead, if desired, the process must announce its intent to terminate.
In the case of failure, the process fails silently.

A process cannot be restarted.
Instead, a new process must be created that may be considered the logical successor or the logical equivalent of the terminated process.

A _term_ event may denote both a normal planned termination, or an abnormal unplanned termination, fail-stop.

The behavior of a process is represented by its trace, a totally ordered sequence of events, such as sending or receiving a message.

Within a process, events are totally ordered.
However, across processes, events are only partially ordered.

Processes emit events through executions.

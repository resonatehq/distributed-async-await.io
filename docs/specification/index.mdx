:::tip Protocols, Definitions, and Models

Distributed Async Await is a collection of protocols, sub specifications (definitions), and models.

:::

The specification is structured into three parts:

- Programming model: Defines the intended structure of distributed programs and the developer interface.
- Execution model: Defines how distributed programs reliably make progress.
- System model: Defines the environment in which distributed programs exist, and thus a way of thinking about distributed programs.

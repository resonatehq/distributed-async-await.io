Distributed Async Await, like _async/await_, builds on two abstractions, functions and promises.
Functions are a universal abstraction for computation, promises are a universal abstraction for coordination.

Functions compose recursively, that is, a function may call other functions spanning a [Call Graph](/system-model/call-graphs).
The Call Graph provides a flexible lens onto a computation.
The call graph is zoomable, allowing one to expand a caller into its callees, treating a function as a composite, or collapse those callees into the caller, treating the function as atomic.
This flexibility enables reasoning at different levels of abstraction.

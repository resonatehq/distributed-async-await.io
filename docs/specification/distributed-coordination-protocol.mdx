The **Distributed Coordination Protocol** is responsible for the coordination of distributed function executions.

## Eventual Resumption

Eventual resumption occurs when when the calling execution E<sub>1</sub> awaits a promise P<sub>2</sub> that is not yet resolved.
The calling execution E<sub>1</sub> is suspended until the promise P<sub>2</sub> is resolved or rejected.

1. When the calling execution E<sub>1</sub>, identified by Durable Promise P<sub>1</sub> and hosted on worker W<sub>1</sub>, invokes a function remotely, W<sub>1</sub> sends a request to create a Durable Promise (P<sub>2</sub>) to the server S.

2. Upon receiving the request, the server S creates the durable promise P<sub>2</sub>.

3. The Server S sends a response to W<sub>1</sub> which forwards P<sub>2</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>.

4. The server S sends an Invoke(P<sub>2</sub>) message to process group G<sub>B</sub>, here delivered to worker W<sub>2</sub>

5. Worker W<sub>2</sub> spawns execution E<sub>2</sub>

6. When the calling execution E<sub>1</sub> awaits promise P<sub>2</sub>, W<sub>1</sub> sends a request to register a callback Resume(P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>) deliverable to G<sub>A</sub> with preference W<sub>1</sub> on P<sub>2</sub> to server S

7. Upon receiving the request, since P<sub>2</sub> is still pending, server S registers the callback C<sub>1</sub> with promise P<sub>2</sub>.

8. Server S sends a response indicating success to worker W<sub>1</sub>, which suspends E<sub>1</sub>

9. When the called execution E<sub>2</sub> returns, the worker W<sub>2</sub> sends a request to resolve or reject durable promise P<sub>2</sub> to the server S

10. Upon receiving the request, the server S resolves or rejects the durable promise P<sub>2</sub>.

11. Server S sends a response containing P<sub>2</sub> to W<sub>2</sub>.

12.The server S sends a Resume(P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>) message to process group G<sub>A</sub> with the preference of W<sub>1</sub>, here delivered to worker W<sub>1</sub>, which suspends E<sub>1</sub>.

## Immediate Resumption

Immediate resumption occurs when the calling execution E<sub>1</sub> awaits a promise P<sub>2</sub> that is already resolved.

1. When the calling execution E<sub>1</sub>, identified by durable promise P<sub>1</sub> and hosted on worker W<sub>1</sub>, invokes a function remotely, W<sub>1</sub> sends a request to create a durable promise P<sub>2</sub> to the server S.

2. Upon receiving the request, the server S creates the durable promise P<sub>2</sub>.

3. Server S sends a response to W<sub>1</sub>, which forwards P<sub>2</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>.

4. The server S sends an Invoke(P<sub>2</sub>) message to process group G<sub>B</sub>, here delivered to worker W<sub>2</sub>.

5. Worker W<sub>2</sub> spawns execution E<sub>2</sub>.

6. When the called execution E<sub>2</sub> returns, the worker W<sub>2</sub> sends a request to resolve or reject durable promise P<sub>2</sub> to the server S.

7. Upon receiving the request, the server S resolves or rejects the durable promise P<sub>2</sub>.

8. Server S sends a response containing P<sub>2</sub> to W<sub>2</sub>.

9. When the calling execution E<sub>1</sub> awaits promise P<sub>2</sub>, W<sub>1</sub> sends a request to register a callback Resume(P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>) deliverable to G<sub>A</sub> with preference W<sub>1</sub> on P<sub>2</sub> to server S.

10. Upon receiving the request, since P<sub>2</sub> is already completed, server S **does not** register a callback.

11. Server S sends a response indicating the callback was not registered because the promise is already completed to worker W<sub>1</sub>, which resumes E<sub>1</sub>.

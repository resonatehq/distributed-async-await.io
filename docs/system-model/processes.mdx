On a process level, a system is a collection of processes, each process has a unique identity.
A process has a well-defined lifecycle, represented by the lifecycle events _init_ and _term_, that governs its participation in the system:

**Init**

_init_ marks the initialization of the process and represents its entry into the system.

**Term**

_term_ marks the termination of the process and represents its exit from the system.

A process cannot emit events outside its (_init_, _term_) interval.
As a consequence, a process cannot announce its termination after its termination.
Instead, if desired, the process must announce its intent to terminate.
In case of failure, the process fails silently.

A process cannot be restarted. Instead, a new process must be created that may be considered the logical successor or the logical equivalent of the terminated process.

:::note Figure sm.p.1

A process has a well-defined lifecycle, represented by the lifecycle events init and term, that governs its participation in the system.
A process may raise events such as send or receive events only within its (initial, term)

:::

A _term_ event may denote both a normal planned termination, or an abnormal unplanned termination ([fail-stop](/system-model/failure))).

Physical Processes are the atomic units of locality.
This specification does not include a notion of physical nodes.

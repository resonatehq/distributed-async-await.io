A distributed system is a collection of concurrent components ([processes](/system-model/processes)) that communicate by exchanging messages over the network.
Each component has exclusive access to its local state as well as its local channel to the networkÔºçIn other words, components do not share state and cannot directly observe each other.

The behavior of a distributed system emerges from the behavior of its process.
The behavior of a process is represented by its trace, a totally ordered sequence of events, such as sending or receiving a message.

Within a process, events are totally ordered.
However, across processes, events are only partially ordered.
We will reason about a system from a global point of view, but that is an idealized view that is not available to any one process
